## Before getting started, here's how to submit the homework
1. Fork this repo to your own account
2. Clone it to your local machine (make sure it is the forked copy)
  - `git clone <url>`
3. Do the homework in the `functions.js` file
4. Push your work up to github with the following steps:
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "commit message goes here"` 
  - To test your code, run `node functions.js`

**Do Not** do the next three lines (pushing to github) - we will do this tomorrow morning
  - `git push origin master`
  - On github, open up a pull request
  - Add your name to the title section and create the pull request with your completion and comfort levels and any questions you may have.
